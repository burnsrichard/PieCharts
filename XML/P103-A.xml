	<!-- Graphic: Android's split personality, 2014 edition. Comparison with iOS How fragmented 
	has Android become? From OpenSignal's findings: 18,796 distinct Android configurations seen in
	2014 11,868 seen in 2013 3,997 seen in 2012. Things are simpler for iOS developers. The same
	survey found 91% of Apple devices running iOS 7, the current operating system version, and 99%
	running either iOS 7 or iOS 6. Moreover, iOS devices come in only four sizes. (See graphics
	below.) Despite the challenges posed by fragmentation, OpenSignal argues that the benefits
	outweigh the drawbacks. "Android is now the dominant mobile operating system," the report
	concludes, "and this is because of fragmentation, not in spite of it." -->
